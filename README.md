## 🧩 Screen Flow

```
landing → upload-selfie → link-generated → waiting
                                               ↓
         share/[token] → partner-landing → partner-upload → meme-reveal → final
```

All screen transitions are managed via a `useState` state machine in `app/page.tsx` with Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence` for animated transitions.

## ☁️ Deployment

Deployed on **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)** with **[Supabase](https://supabase.com)** as the storage and database backend.


### Supabase Setup

- **Storage bucket** — for selfie uploads (set to public read)
- **Sessions table** — stores `token`, `selfie_url`, `partner_selfie_url`, `nickname`, `private_message`
- **Realtime** — enabled on the sessions table so the waiting screen can live-poll for partner completion
